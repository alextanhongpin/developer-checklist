# Developer Checklist

This is my personal checklist to mark my progress in programming. :)
It includes the things I have covered/am interested to learn. 

## Machine Learning

Currently exploring this domain. Already gone through the fundamentals through the book `Introduction to Statistical Learning` (ISLR) and currently working on sample python codes. Solved some problems from Project Euler too.

- [x] Resampling Methods
- [x] Non-Linear Model
- [ ] Tree-Based Methods
- [ ] Support Vector Machines
- [ ] Unsupervised Learning
- [ ] Computer Vision (In progress)
